# CS-212-Queue
Project 3A code for CS 212 at the University of Oregon. This assignment required us to create a C program that implements a queue using dynamic memory and a circular array queue.

The project includes three files: project3A.c includes the main function and takes user input, project3A_queue.c implements the queue functionality, and project3A_queue.h is the header file for the queue functionality.
